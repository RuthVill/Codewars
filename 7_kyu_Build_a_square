/* INSTRUCTIONS 
I will give you an integer. Give me back a shape that is as long 
and wide as the integer. The integer will be a whole number between 0 and 50.

Example
n = 3, so I expect a 3x3 square back just like below as a string:

+++
+++
+++

*/

//SOLUTION

function generateShape(int){
let amount = "";
        for (let i =0 ; i < int; i++){
               for (let j = 1; j <= int; j++){
               amount +=("+");
              }
        amount += "\n";
            }
return amount.trim();
}
